The application should ensure that the supplied value for a redirect is permitted. This can be achieved by performing allowlisting on the parameter value.

The allowlist should contain a list of pages or sites that the application is permitted to redirect users to. If the supplied value does not match any value in the whitelist then the server should redirect to a standard error page.
