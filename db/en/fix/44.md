To mitigate CSRF attacks, web developers can implement the following security measures:

- **Anti-CSRF Tokens:** Include unique tokens in each form or request that are verified on the server side. These tokens prevent attackers from crafting requests without knowledge of the token.
- **SameSite Cookies:** Set the "SameSite" attribute for cookies to restrict their scope and prevent them from being sent on cross-site requests.
- **Use POST Requests:** Design critical actions to be triggered via HTTP POST requests rather than GET requests, as the latter are more susceptible to CSRF attacks.
- **Check Referrer Header:** Validate the "Referer" header of incoming requests to ensure they originate from the expected domain.

By implementing these preventive measures, web applications can significantly reduce the risk of CSRF attacks and protect users from having their actions manipulated by malicious actors.
