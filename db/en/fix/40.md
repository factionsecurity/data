To mitigate these risks, it's generally recommended to limit cookie scope to specific subdomains where they are truly needed. This practice, known as "cookie domain scoping," helps ensure that cookies are accessible only from the intended subdomains and reduces the risk of data leakage and unauthorized access.

In situations where there is a legitimate need for cookies to be accessible across multiple subdomains, careful considerations and security measures are crucial. Implementing secure coding practices, using secure cookies (e.g., with the Secure and HttpOnly flags), and employing proper authentication mechanisms can help minimize the security risks associated with setting cookies to a parent domain scope.
