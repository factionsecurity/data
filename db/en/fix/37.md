Implementing a CAPTCHA on a website is an effective way to prevent automated bots from abusing your forms while still allowing legitimate users to interact seamlessly. There are several recommended methods to implement CAPTCHA on a website:

- __Text-based CAPTCHA:__ Implement a simple text-based CAPTCHA where users are asked to enter a sequence of characters or numbers displayed in an image. This method is less user-friendly and may be less effective against advanced bots, but it's a basic way to add an extra layer of protection.
- __Audio CAPTCHA:__ Provide an option for users to solve an audio-based CAPTCHA if they have difficulty with visual challenges. This can be particularly useful for users with visual impairments.
- __Time-based CAPTCHA:__ Add a time-based challenge that requires users to complete a task within a certain time frame. Bots often struggle with completing tasks quickly, giving humans an advantage.
- __Behavioral Analysis:__ Some CAPTCHA solutions focus on analyzing user behavior and interactions with the website to distinguish between humans and bots. These methods look for patterns in mouse movements, keyboard input, and navigation to make a determination.
