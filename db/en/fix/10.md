Mitigating the risk associated with sensitive files, including passwords, configurations, and log files, involves careful placement and authentication practices. It is essential to avoid storing these files within directories accessible via the web. Instead, they should be situated outside of the web context. However, if application functionality necessitates their web accessibility, a robust security measure such as strong authentication, preferably employing two-factor authentication, should be enforced to safeguard these sensitive files.
