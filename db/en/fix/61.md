To mitigate against HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities, consider implementing the following  measures:

1. **Embrace HTTP/2 End-to-End:**
    - Whenever possible, opt for end-to-end utilization of HTTP/2 and disable HTTP downgrading. HTTP/2 employs a robust mechanism for determining request length, providing inherent protection against request smuggling.
2. **Validate Rewritten Requests:**
    - In scenarios where HTTP downgrading is unavoidable, meticulously validate rewritten requests against the HTTP/1.1 specification. Enforce strict validation criteria, such as rejecting requests containing newlines in headers, colons in header names, and spaces in the request method.
3. **Normalize Ambiguous Requests:**
    - Implement a strategy where the front-end server normalizes ambiguous requests, and the back-end server rejects any that remain ambiguous, subsequently closing the TCP connection. This ensures a consistent understanding of request boundaries between the two servers.
4. **Account for Request Bodies:**
    - Avoid assuming that requests won't include a body, as this assumption underlies both CL.0 and client-side desync vulnerabilities. Be attentive to potential request body presence as a fundamental precaution.
5. **Discard Connection on Server Exceptions:**
    - Default to discarding the connection if server-level exceptions are triggered during request handling. This approach minimizes the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities that may arise when exceptions occur.
6. **Enable Upstream HTTP/2 for Forward Proxies:**
    - If traffic is routed through a forward proxy, ensure that upstream HTTP/2 is enabled whenever possible. This aids in maintaining consistency in request handling and reducing the likelihood of request smuggling vulnerabilities.
