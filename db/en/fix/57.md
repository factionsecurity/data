Mitigating sensitive data exposure and shoulder surfing in a web application requires the implementation of security measures aimed at preventing unauthorized individuals from viewing sensitive information displayed on users' screens. Here are several effective strategies to mitigate the risk of shoulder surfing:

1. **Password Fields:**
   - Utilize Password Input Types: Employ HTML input type "password" for password entry to obscure characters as bullet points or asterisks, preventing easy reading of the input.
   - Disable Autocomplete: Prevent browsers from suggesting or remembering passwords by disabling autocomplete for password fields.
2. **Masking Data:**
   - Dynamic Masking: Implement dynamic input masking, converting visible characters to asterisks or dots as users enter information. This hinders sensitive data interpretation by shoulder surfers.
   - Partial Display: Only reveal partial information, such as displaying the last four digits of a credit card number. Avoid returning the full credit card number to the application.
3. **Return Only Partial Sensitive Information:** 
    - The application should be designed so that sensitive data is never returned to the web browser and only returns what is necessary for the user to validate the data. For Example: Only send data to the web browser with just the last 4 digits of a Social Security Number or Credit Card. This will ensure that if the account is compromised that the attacker only has part of the information. 

By integrating these comprehensive strategies into a web application's design, developers can effectively safeguard sensitive information data disclosure and shoulder surfing threats.
