To mitigate this vulnerability, the following actions are recommended:

1. Implement prepared statements or parameterized queries in the application code to separate user input from SQL statements.
2. Perform input validation and filtering to ensure that user inputs conform to expected formats and data types.
3. Review and update the codebase to escape special characters in user input before incorporating them into SQL queries if prepared statements cannot be used.
4. Conduct a thorough security review of the application to identify and fix any existing SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
