It is recommend to scan the entire code base to fine all the locations of passwords and secrets. Replace them with one or more of the following methods. 

1. **Use Environment Variables or Configuration Files**:  
    Store sensitive information, such as passwords and API keys, in environment variables or external configuration files separate from the source code. This keeps them out of version control and limits access to authorized personnel.
2. **Leverage Secure Key Management Systems**:
     Use secure key management systems (e.g., AWS Key Management Service, HashiCorp Vault) to store and retrieve sensitive data securely. Access to these systems should be tightly controlled.
3. **Implement Encryption and Hashing**:
     Apply encryption and hashing techniques to protect sensitive data stored in configuration files or databases, ensuring that even if accessed, the data remains unreadable and unusable.
4. **Follow Credential Management Best Practices**:
     Implement strong password policies, regular credential rotations, and access controls to mitigate the impact of potential compromises.
