It is recommend to pin the certificate  based on the `subjectPublicKeyInfo` (SPKI). This is a technique where the public key of a server's certificate is used as the basis for pinning rather than the entire certificate. This approach provides a more granular and flexible way to validate the certificate, as it specifically targets the public key that's used for encryption, rather than the entire certificate, which contains additional metadata. Here's how to implement certificate pinning based on `subjectPublicKeyInfo`:

1. **Obtain the Server's Public Key:**
    To begin, you need to obtain the public key of the server's certificate. This can be done by extracting the `subjectPublicKeyInfo` from the server's certificate. You can use libraries or tools like OpenSSL or cryptography libraries in your chosen programming language to extract this information.
2. **Hash the SPKI:**
    Calculate the hash of the `subjectPublicKeyInfo`. This can be done using a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256). The resulting hash will serve as the pinned value in your application.
3. **Store the Hash in Code:**
    Embed the calculated hash in your application's source code. This hash should be stored securely and should match the hash of the server's `subjectPublicKeyInfo`.
4. **Verify the SPKI During Connection:**
    When the application establishes an SSL/TLS connection to the server, extract the `subjectPublicKeyInfo` from the server's certificate during the handshake.
5. **Compare with the Pinned Hash:**
    Compare the extracted `subjectPublicKeyInfo` hash with the pinned hash stored in your application. If they match, the certificate is considered valid, and the connection proceeds. If they don't match, the connection is rejected, and appropriate action is taken, such as notifying the user or logging the event.
