App owners should use at least TLS 1.2 or, ideally, TLS 1.3 to ensure a secure and reliable connection for their applications. TLS 1.2 is widely supported and provides strong security, while TLS 1.3 offers even better security with improved performance and reduced latency. Upgrading to TLS 1.3 is recommended for applications where it is feasible, but TLS 1.2 remains a secure and practical choice for most use cases. It's crucial to stay up-to-date with security best practices and regularly update TLS versions to protect user data and maintain the integrity of your application.
