Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker exploits a weakness in a web application's input validation process. This allows the attacker to inject malicious code into the web page viewed by other users, leading to the execution of the injected code in the victim's browser. Poor input validation is often the root cause of XSS vulnerabilities, as it allows attackers to inject code or scripts that can manipulate user input and execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. To prevent XSS attacks, it is essential to ensure that all user input is properly validated and sanitized before being used in web pages or applications. This can be achieved through techniques such as input filtering, encoding, and validation, which help to remove any malicious code and prevent it from being executed on the user's system.
