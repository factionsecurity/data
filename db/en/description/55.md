Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when a web application allows untrusted data to be included in a web page that is then served to other users. This can enable an attacker to inject malicious scripts (usually written in JavaScript) into web pages viewed by other users. The malicious scripts can then execute in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to various security issues and attacks.

In a reflected XSS attack, the injected script is not permanently stored on the target server. Instead, it's reflected off a web server or application and is immediately executed in the context of the user's browser. This typically happens when a user clicks on a malicious link or interacts with a specially crafted URL that includes the malicious script. The script is then executed in the context of the current user's session.
