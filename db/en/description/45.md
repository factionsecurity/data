SQL injection occurs when an attacker manipulates SQL queries by introducing malicious code through string concatenation. This typically happens when an application directly combines user input with SQL statements without proper validation or sanitization. Here's how SQL injection is introduced through string concatenation:

1. User Input: A web application takes user input, which could be provided through forms, query parameters, or other input fields. This user input is usually in the form of strings.

2. SQL Query Building: The application constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating the user input with SQL statements. For example, consider the following pseudocode:

   ```python
   username = user_input  # User-provided input
   sql_query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'"
   ```

   In this example, the user's input is directly included in the SQL query without any validation or sanitation.

3. Malicious Input: An attacker identifies the input field as vulnerable and provides malicious input that contains SQL code. This input is crafted to manipulate the SQL query's structure and behavior.

4. Injection: The attacker's input is inserted into the SQL query. For instance, if the attacker inputs `username' OR '1'='1`, the resulting query becomes:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'username' OR '1'='1'
   ```

   The injected code `'1'='1'` is always true, effectively bypassing any username check and returning all records in the "users" table.

5. Query Execution: The modified SQL query is executed by the application and sent to the database server for processing. The database server interprets the query, including the injected code, leading to unintended behavior.

6. Results: The database server returns the results, which may include unauthorized access to data, data manipulation, or other actions as directed by the attacker's injected SQL code.

SQL injection through string concatenation is a common and severe security risk because it allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL code within the application's database. To prevent this vulnerability, it's essential to use prepared statements or parameterized queries to ensure that user input is treated as data and not as executable SQL code. Additionally, input validation and strict data type checking can help protect against SQL injection by rejecting input that does not conform to expected formats.
