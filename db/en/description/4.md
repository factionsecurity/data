A common practice when administering web applications is to create a copy/backup of a particular file or directory before making any modification to the file. Another common practice is to add an extension or change the name of the original file to signify that it is a backup (examples include `.bak`, `.orig`, `.backup`, etc.). 

During the initial recon stages of an attack, an attacker will attempt to locate backup files by adding common extensions onto files already discovered on the web server. By analyzing the response headers from the server they can determine if the backup file exists. These backup files can then assist in the compromise of the web
application.
