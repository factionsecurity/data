Certificate pinning is a security feature implemented in the application to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and enhance the integrity of SSL/TLS connections. It enforces a strict policy where the client verifies that the server's certificate matches a predefined set of trusted certificates or public keys. This mechanism is essential to ensure that the client communicates only with legitimate servers and rejects connections from potentially malicious sources.

Certificate pinning adds an extra layer of security to the application by mitigating the risk of an attacker intercepting or impersonating the communication between the client and the server. Without pinning, an attacker could use a rogue certificate issued by a compromised or malicious certificate authority to intercept or manipulate the data exchanged between the client and the server. By enforcing certificate pinning, the application reduces this risk significantly.
