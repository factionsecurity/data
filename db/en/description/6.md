A code injection vulnerability is a type of security flaw that occurs when an attacker is able to insert malicious code or commands into an application's codebase, causing that code to be executed by the application itself. This type of vulnerability typically arises due to improper input validation and lack of proper security controls within the application. Code injection attacks can lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, system compromise, and other malicious activities.

__How Code Injection Vulnerability Happens:__

- __User Input:__ Many applications take user input in various forms, such as text fields, query parameters, or URL paths. This input is then used by the application to generate dynamic content, interact with databases, or execute certain actions.

- __Lack of Input Validation:__ If an application does not properly validate and sanitize user input, it becomes vulnerable to code injection attacks. Input validation involves checking user-provided data to ensure that it conforms to expected formats and doesn't contain malicious code.

- __Injection Points:__ Attackers identify places within the application where user input is directly incorporated into the code without proper validation. These points are often called "injection points." Common injection points include SQL queries, OS commands, JavaScript code, and more.

- __Malicious Payloads:__ Attackers craft malicious payloads, which are snippets of code or commands intended to be executed by the application. These payloads are designed to exploit the specific vulnerability present in the injection point.

- __Execution:__ When an attacker successfully injects a malicious payload, the application unwittingly treats it as legitimate code and executes it in the application's context. Depending on the vulnerability and the nature of the payload, various types of attacks can occur.

__Types of Code Injection Attacks:__

- __SQL Injection (SQLi):__ Attackers inject malicious SQL queries into input fields, tricking the application into executing unintended database queries. This can lead to unauthorized access to the database or manipulation of stored data.
- __Command Injection:__ Attackers inject malicious operating system commands into input fields, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This can lead to system compromise or unauthorized access.
- __Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):__ Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages, which are then executed by users' browsers. This can lead to the theft of user session data, spreading of malware, or defacement of web pages.
- __Remote Code Execution (RCE):__ Attackers execute arbitrary code on the server by injecting malicious code. This can result in complete control of the server, data breaches, and more.
- __Server-Side Template Injection:__ Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in template engines to inject malicious code into server-side templates, allowing them to execute code on the server and potentially gain control.
