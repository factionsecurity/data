Hard-coded secrets and passwords in source code refer to the practice of embedding sensitive information directly into the application's code, making them easily accessible and visible. This approach is considered a security vulnerability because it exposes critical credentials (such as API keys, passwords, cryptographic keys) to anyone with access to the source code, posing a significant risk to the application's security.

### Risks and Implications:

1. **Unauthorized Access**: Malicious actors or unauthorized individuals can easily identify and misuse the embedded credentials to gain unauthorized access to the application or related systems.
    
2. **Compromised Security**: Hard-coded credentials compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the application and associated systems, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions.
    
3. **Difficulty in Updating**: Changing hard-coded credentials requires modifying and recompiling the source code, which is time-consuming and error-prone, hindering timely updates and patches.
    
4. **Lack of Compliance**: Embedding sensitive data directly into the code violates security best practices and may breach regulatory or compliance requirements.
