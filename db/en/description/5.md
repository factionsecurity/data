One of the significant vulnerabilities that warrant the implementation of a CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) to protect online forms is the risk of form spam and automated attacks. Online forms, including contact forms, registration forms, comment sections, and login pages, are susceptible to exploitation by malicious actors and automated bots. This vulnerability can lead to various negative consequences, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and resource wastage.

__Attack Scenario: Form Spam__

Malicious actors and spambots target online forms to flood them with unwanted or malicious content, often in the form of advertisements, links to malware-infected sites, or phishing attempts. Without adequate protection mechanisms, attackers can deploy automated scripts that repeatedly submit forms with spam content, overwhelming the targeted website's server and potentially causing it to slow down or crash. This not only disrupts the website's normal functionality but can also create a negative user experience for genuine users trying to interact with the form.

__Attack Scenario: Credential Stuffing and Brute-Force Attacks__

Another form of automated attack is credential stuffing and brute-force attacks. Attackers utilize automated tools to enter numerous username and password combinations into login forms, attempting to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. These attacks exploit weak passwords, and since they are automated, they can be conducted at a rapid pace, putting user accounts at risk of compromise. If successful, attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, financial data, and other personal details stored within the compromised accounts.

__Attack Scenario: Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks__

Some attackers employ automated tools to send a high volume of requests to online forms, overwhelming the server's resources and causing a Denial of Service (DoS) situation. By bombarding the forms with excessive submissions, the attackers consume the server's processing power and network bandwidth, making the website inaccessible to legitimate users. This type of attack can be particularly damaging for e-commerce platforms, news websites, and other services that heavily rely on user interactions.
