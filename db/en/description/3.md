A common practice when administering web applications is to create a copy/backup of a particular directory before making any modification. Another common practice is to add an extension or change the name of the original directory to signify that it is a backup (examples include `.bak`, `.orig`, `.backup`, etc.).

During the initial recon stages of an attack, an attacker will attempt to locate backup directories by adding common extensions onto directories already discovered on the webserver. By analyzing the response headers from the server they can determine if a backup directory
exists. These backup directories can then assist in the compromise of the web application.
