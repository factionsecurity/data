Sending sensitive data in the query string of a URL poses several security risks. The query string is the part of a URL that follows the "?" symbol and typically contains key-value pairs. Here are some of the risks associated with including sensitive data in the query string:

1. **Visibility**: The query string is often visible in browser history, server logs, and can be easily bookmarked. If sensitive information, such as passwords or personal details, is included in the query string, it becomes more vulnerable to unauthorized access.
    
2. **Logging and Analytics**: Web servers and various third-party services might log URLs, including the query string. This means that sensitive data could be stored in logs, making it accessible to administrators or attackers with access to those logs.
    
3. **Caching**: Proxy servers and caching mechanisms might store URLs, including the query string, as part of the caching process. This poses a risk of sensitive information being stored on servers beyond the control of the application.
    
4. **Referrer Headers**: When a user clicks on a link, the referring page's URL, including the query string, is often included in the HTTP request headers. If the query string contains sensitive information, it could be leaked to other websites.
