A sensitive information disclosure vulnerability occurs when an application or system unintentionally exposes sensitive data to unauthorized individuals or entities. This vulnerability can take various forms and may involve different types of sensitive information, such as personal data, passwords, financial details, or proprietary business information.

If an application or system displays sensitive information, such as credit cards, passwords or other confidential data, on the screen without adequate protection, it becomes vulnerable to shoulder surfing. Individuals nearby may glance at the screen and gain access to sensitive details without proper authorization.

This issue can also arise when the application returns the full contents of sensitive fields to the web interface even if the interface masks the data on screen. For example, the server could return the full saved credit card number to the web interface and through javascript or other masking techniques only displays part of the credit card number. In this instance, there is no reason to return the full sensitive details and if an attacker were able to gain unauthorized access to the user's account, it would disclose additional information that could be used to further compromise the user.  :w
