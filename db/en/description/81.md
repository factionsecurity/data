HTTP request smuggling is a complex attack that capitalizes on the differences in how various components interpret and process HTTP requests, allowing attackers to bypass security controls and potentially compromise the integrity and confidentiality of web applications. These discrepancies often arise from differences in parsing rules between different systems involved in request handling.

The exploitation often revolves around the ambiguity in handling the `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers, creating confusion in how the length of the message body is determined

The crux of HTTP request smuggling lies in exploiting differences in how front-end and back-end servers interpret these headers. For instance, an attacker may send a request with a mismatch in the Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers, causing confusion between the two servers. The front-end server might use one header to determine the message length, while the back-end server relies on the other, leading to a divergence in their understanding of the request.

Crafty manipulation of these headers allows attackers to insert payloads strategically, taking advantage of the confusion in interpretation. By carefully constructing requests, an attacker might smuggle additional requests or payloads past security measures, gaining unauthorized access or performing actions that were not intended by the application.
