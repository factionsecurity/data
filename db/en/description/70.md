Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when a web application allows untrusted data to be included in a web page that is then served to other users. This can enable an attacker to inject malicious scripts (usually written in JavaScript) into web pages viewed by other users. The malicious scripts can then execute in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to various security issues and attacks.

Stored or persistent XSS happens when the injected script is permanently stored on the target server and is later served to users when they request a particular web page. This can happen, for example, in comment sections, forums, or user profiles where the input is not properly sanitized and validated. When other users view the page with the stored script, their browsers execute it, potentially allowing an attacker to steal their session cookies, personal data, or perform other malicious actions.
