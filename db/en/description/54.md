XPath Injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an application uses user-supplied input to construct XPath queries without proper validation or sanitization. XPath (XML Path Language) is a language used to navigate and query XML documents, and it is commonly used in web applications to retrieve data from XML-based data sources like XML files or databases. XPath Injection can have serious consequences when exploited by malicious actors, as it can lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, or even code execution on a vulnerable system.

Here's how XPath Injection works and why it's a security concern:

1. User Input: Web applications often accept user input, such as search queries, form data, or parameters in the URL, and use that input to construct XPath queries to retrieve data from an XML source.
    
2. Lack of Input Validation: Insecure applications do not properly validate or sanitize the user input. Instead, they directly include the user-supplied data in the XPath query.
    
3. Malicious Payload: An attacker can manipulate the user input to inject malicious XPath expressions into the application. They can add special characters or craft XPath statements to modify the original query's behavior.
    
4. XPath Query Manipulation: The injected XPath expression can be used to extract sensitive data, modify data, or perform actions on the XML source that the application did not intend.
    
5. Consequences: Depending on the vulnerability's severity and the attacker's skill, XPath Injection can lead to unauthorized access to restricted data, data exfiltration, or even remote code execution on the server.
