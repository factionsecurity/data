Email addresses are typically found on "Contact us" pages, however,
they can also be found within scripts or code comments of the
application. They are used to provide a legitimate means of contacting
an organization.

As one of the initial steps in information
gathering, an attacker will spider a website and use automated
methods collect as many email addresses as possible, that they may
then use it in a social engineering attack.

Using the same automated
methods, the tool was able to detect one or more email addresses that
were stored within the affected page.
