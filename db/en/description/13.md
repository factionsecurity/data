Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of security vulnerability that exploits the trust a web application has in a user's browser, usually by taking advantage of an authenticated user's session. In a CSRF attack, an attacker tricks an authenticated user into unknowingly performing actions on a vulnerable web application without their consent by enticing the user to click a specially crafted link or by the user navigating to a malicious page that then makes hidden requests to the vulnerable application. These actions can range from changing account settings to initiating financial transactions, depending on the privileges of the targeted user.

Here's how a CSRF attack works:

1. **User Authentication:** The user logs into a legitimate web application and establishes a session, which often involves obtaining a session cookie.

2. **Attack Setup:** The attacker crafts a malicious website or email containing a specially crafted URL or form that sends a request to the targeted application. This request could involve changing user settings, initiating transactions, or performing other actions that require user interaction.

3. **User Interaction:** The attacker entices the user to visit the malicious website or click on the malicious link. Once the user does this, their browser sends the request with the user's session cookie to the targeted application.

4. **Trusted Context:** The targeted application, being unable to distinguish between a legitimate request and the forged one, executes the action because it sees the request coming from the user's browser with a valid session.

5. **Unauthorized Action:** The user's account settings or other sensitive actions are changed without their consent. This occurs because the application is tricked into believing the action was initiated by the user themselves.

CSRF attacks are particularly dangerous because they exploit the trust that web applications have in the user's browser. The attacker doesn't need to compromise the user's credentials; instead, they manipulate the user into performing actions on their behalf without their knowledge.
