The design of many web applications requires that users be able to upload files that will either be stored or processed by the receiving web server.

The tool has flagged this not as a vulnerability, but as a prompt for the penetration tester to conduct further manual testing on the file upload function.

An insecure form-based file upload could allow an attacker a means to abuse and successfully exploit the server directly, and/or any third party that may later access the file. This can occur by uploading a file containing the server side-code (such as PHP) that is then executed when requested by the client.
