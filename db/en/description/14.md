Concurrent Version System (CVS) and Subversion (SVN) are tools that developers use to manage different versions of their code as it evolves over time.

Sometimes, the version control system might not store developer or user information correctly within the code. In such cases, this information might unintentionally become visible to end users, either directly in the HTML or within code comments. As a preliminary step in gathering information, malicious actors may crawl a website and employ automated techniques to identify any CVS/SVN-related information present on the page.

This information can be valuable to attackers as it provides insights into the deployed application. It might reveal version details, aiding the attacker's understanding of the application's technology stack. Furthermore, this data could contribute to additional reconnaissance or social engineering attacks.

Using similar automated methods, a scanning process was able to identify instances where CVS or SVN details were stored on the affected page.
