Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when a web application allows untrusted data to be included in a web page that is then served to other users. This can enable an attacker to inject malicious scripts (usually written in JavaScript) into web pages viewed by other users. The malicious scripts can then execute in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to various security issues and attacks.

DOM-based XSS occurs on the client side in the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page. It involves the manipulation of the page's JavaScript to execute malicious code. Unlike stored and reflected XSS, DOM-based XSS does not involve server-side vulnerabilities but rather relies on the manipulation of the client-side code.
